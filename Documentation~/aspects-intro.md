# Aspect concepts

> [!WARNING]  
> Aspects are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use component access and query methods directly instead.

An aspect is an object-like wrapper that you can use to group together a subset of an entity's components into a single C# struct.

This section explains how to use aspects within your project.
