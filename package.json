    "changelog": "### Added\n\n* The SystemTypeIndex associated with a SystemHandle can now be retrieved. Furthermore, multiple methods, which allow for better system access, have been added.\n* Disabled, Present, Absent and None components on queries in the System inspector.\n* Dependency tab in the System inspector, which shows the components a system depends on.\n* Prefabs now stand out as prefabs in the query window.\n\n### Changed\n\n* ChunkEntityEnumerator performance has been improved in every case except when running with useEnabledMask = false on Mono where it got about twice as slow. If this is problematic, use a for loop instead in this particular case.\n* Updated Burst dependency to version 1.8.21\n\n### Fixed\n\n* `ComponentLookup.TryGetRefRW<T>()` now correctly updates the change version for type `T` in the target chunk.\n* Now you can use fully specified generic components as parameter in an IJobEntity.Execute\n* Now you can use conditional using statements in the middle of other using statements when you have a source file containing an IJobEntity\n* Multiple issues in the entities documentation has been fixed.\n* FastEquality returned incorrect results for nested structs.\n* Referencing a UnityEngine.Component in a UnityObjectRef, no longer causes build errors.\n* When the clone of a companion GameObject is instantiated (during Live Conversion) it is now placed inside the correct scene on instantiation.\n* `SystemAPI.Query` no longer generates duplicate component references if `.WithChangeFilter<T>()` is used in with `.WithDisabled<T>()` or `.WithPresent<T>()`.\n* Removed a broken link to the SystemInstance structure in the package documentation.\n* TypeManager.Initialize is much faster due to lazily registering companion component types."
